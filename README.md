### 4th Core Studio, Architecture ,2017 Sping, Harvard GSD

This workshop is for students to gain the fundamental foundation for design scripting from basic polygon modeling to visualization (animation or rendering), at Harvard Graduate School of Design.  

The aim of the workshop is that
students will gain the concept of parametric, procedure, algorithm, and numerical design with maxscript, and will learn hands-on skills of digital representation as a form of videos or images in action

#### basic maxscript
- creation: geometry, spline, light and camera
- syntax: loop, cast, function, and so on   
- modify: polygon(mesh) modeling, and other modifies
- animation: line, surface and volumetric animation in design

#### example
- update needed
